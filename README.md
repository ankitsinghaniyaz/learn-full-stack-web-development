**(pre-pre alpha)**

This in not a tutorial! It is a guideline to help you in learning full stack web development. I do not endorse any technology that I use here, they just the ones I happen to know and like. This guide is desgined in such a way that you can easily replace any technology with the one you prefer. 

This guide highlights the approach I've taken when learning full stack web development. The idea originated when some of my cousins were interested in learning the stuff I do. So I had to come up with this action plan everytime for them. I felt there was really a need for something like this. That gives you the freedom while keeping you focused on the crux.

I prefer this method of learning because it simulates real world cases. You get stuck you go out for help, use StackOverflow, ask a friend, get help on LinkedIn, do anything that you will do in real life.

P.S. This might be a little daunting but you need not worry. Just see one phase at a time.


# Frontend Development

Frontend development is all about the browsers. Anything you see and use on your browser comes under the realm of frontend development. I use the analogy of human body when doing FSD. It might be absurd but fun.
